# Synapse: The Living Media Companion Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Planning & Research
- [x] Audit existing Prism IPTV codebase (React, Three.js/WebGL context)
- [x] Create detailed Implementation Plan for "Adaptive Atmospheric" UI
- [x] Define "Zero-UI" interaction model and state machine

## Phase 2: Core Engine Overhaul
- [x] Implement Real-Time Chromatic Extraction (Chameleon Engine)
- [x] Develop "Cinema Void" 3D Environment with Reflective Floor
- [x] Build "Aerogel" Glassmorphism 2.0 Shader System
- [x] Integrate Reactivity (Global Illumination & Rim Lighting)

## Phase 3: AI Companion (Lumen) Integration
- [x] Create "Bioluminescent" Visual States (Halo/Sparks)
- [x] Implement Lifelike Behaviors (Saccades/Gaze)
- [x] Context-based 3D Architectural Refactor
- [x] Implement 3D Presence & Lighting Integration for Avatar
- [x] Develop "Diegetic Materialization" for generated assets

## Phase 4: "Zero-UI" Interaction Layer
- [ ] Add Physics-Based Motion & Parallax Camera

## Phase 5: Verification & Polish
- [ ] Conduct Visual Fidelity Audit (Wow Factor)
- [ ] Verify Performance & Frame Rates (60Hz Sampling)
- [ ] Final Walkthrough & High-Fidelity Mockups
